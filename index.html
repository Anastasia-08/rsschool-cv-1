  <body>
    Name: Polina Blokhina <br>
    I never used to work as programmer, but I was quite good at school competitions (had prizer's diploms at all-Russian Olympiad at Programming and Maths), and I like to study new things in programming and want to make programming my profession <br>
    I mostly used Delphi, but can write also on Python, Java and JS. Also used Octave to study machine learning. <br>
    I don't have any experiense of projects, but I passed some courses, for example, https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning (but I didn't pay to get a diploma, so I sadly can't show you certificate on my name) <br>
    My English is between Intermediate and Advanced. I don't really have problems with writing nor reading, speaking and listening can be a bit harder, but not much. I used to live abroad (in Bulgaria) and, if people didn't understand Russian and my Bulgarian wasn't enough for something, we communicated in English without any problems. <br>
